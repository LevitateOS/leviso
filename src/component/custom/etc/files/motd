 Hi, and welcome to the LevitateOS Installer. This is the author writing.

  Thank you for your interest in LevitateOS, hopefully the first vibe-coded Linux distro. If you're running this in a VM or on bare metal, this is still in pre-release so bugs are very much expected. Please kindly use the issues tab at levitateOS/levitateOS on github after encountering something odd.

  I expect there to be docs-TUI on the right side of your screen that guides you through this manual installation. (if not, then I guess you have a good reason to make an issue lmao)

 For networking:
   nmcli device wifi list           # List WiFi networks
   nmcli device wifi connect SSID password PASSWORD
